Deck of Cards

Give me a program that can shuffle a deck of cards and deal a pokerhand.
There should be a main menu with deal and quit options.
Choosing deal should prompt the user for the number of players and hand size. The program should handle player counts or hand sizes to large for a standard deck of cards. It should display each hand dealt and allow continued dealing and display of one or more cards or the ability to quit to the main menu at any time. Once the deck is empty it should automatically return to the main menu.
Your deck should be a completely rendomized deck of 52 standard non-repeating playing cards with values and suites and be reshuffled each time the program is run.

Examples:


Input1: 
3 players, 5 cards
Output1: 
Player 1: Ace of spades, Queen of Hearts, Four of Diamonds, Four of Spades, Three of spades 
Player 2: Eight of Diamonds, Nine of Clubs, Nine of Diamonds, Jack of Clubs, Ace of Clubs
Player 3: King of Hearts; Ten of Hearts, Three of Clubs, Two of Hearts, Six of Spades

Input2:
1 Players, 10 Cards
Output2:
Player 1: 9S, 4H, AC, 6C, KH, QS, 8D, 7H, 9D, 10S


CHALLENGE (Not Mandatory)

Make your program actually play through a round of either 5-card draw poker or Texas Hold Em with 2-8 players. Let the users place bets. Give a confirmation before displaying cards so only the person whose card it is will see it.
